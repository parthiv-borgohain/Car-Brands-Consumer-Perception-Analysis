# Car Brands Consumer Perception Analysis

## Introduction: 

In this project, we aimed to understand how consumers perceive car brands by analyzing user-generated content from a car review forum. Data was collected from the Edmunds forum and processed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify the most frequently discussed car brands and attributes. We then evaluated the associations between brands using lift analysis and visualized the results using a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) plot. The goal was to gain insight into how consumers associate certain attributes with specific car brands, in order to inform marketing strategies.

## Approach:

We took the following steps in this project: 

1. Develop a scraping tool using Selenium and Python to gather posts from the Edmunds forum.
    
2. Analyze the data to determine the top 10 most frequently discussed car brands, using frequency counts and a mapping file to link car models to their respective brands.
    
3. Utilize lift scores to identify relationships between brands and create an MDS map to visualize these associations.
    
4. Offer recommendations to brand managers for the brands identified in step 2.
    
5. Determine the top 5 attributes that consumers associate with the top brands.
    
6. Offer suggestions to brand managers for the identified brands based on the above step.
    
7. Identify the most desired brand from the discussions, and evaluate the potential business implications of this brand.
   
## Algorithms/Tools used:
